This folder is for any components you're going to share across multiple pages, like buttons, photos, text boxes.
Anything that has consistent styles across your web app can go here.

Why?

This means you have consistency within your app. everything looks the same across all pages.

You only have to change the code in one place. This reduces bugs and keeps code DRY.
